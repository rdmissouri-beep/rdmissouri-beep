# Hi, I’m Reginald 👋

I’m a Solutions Engineer transitioning deeper into AI engineering, Python development, and intelligent demo automation. I love creating tools, systems, and narratives that help people understand technology in a clear and meaningful way.

### 🌱 What I'm focusing on now
- Strengthening Python fundamentals  
- Hands-on AI engineering projects  
- Building internal tools that streamline demo prep and discovery  
- Exploring voice, audio, and creative AI  

### 🧠 Background
My career has centered around presales, technical storytelling, and helping teams move deals with clarity and confidence. I enjoy translating complex capabilities into real business impact — and I’m now applying that same skill set to my AI work.

### 🛠️ Current Projects
- **learning-python** — foundational exercises and small projects as I grow into AI engineering  
- Early prototypes for demo automation and discovery support tools  

### 🎧 Personal Interests
I’m passionate about storytelling, audio production, and using technology to help people communicate more authentically. When tech and creativity overlap, that’s my sweet spot.
